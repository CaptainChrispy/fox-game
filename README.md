# FOX Game

A simple puzzle game where you must avoid forming the word "FOX" in any direction on a 5x5 grid.

## About

This game is based on a concept I saw in a YouTube video. The challenge is to place tiles containing the letters F, O, and X onto a grid without creating the word "FOX" in any direction - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (forwards or backwards).

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Fill the 5x5 grid with letter tiles without forming "FOX" anywhere
2. **Tiles**: You have 25 tiles, each containing either F, O, or X (randomly distributed)
3. **Hidden Letters**: Tiles are blank until placed - you won't know what letter you're placing until you drop it
4. **Losing**: If "FOX" appears anywhere on the grid (any direction), you lose
5. **Winning**: Successfully place all 25 tiles without forming "FOX"

## Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Drag tiles from the bottom area to any empty grid cell
- **Automatic Mode**: Let the computer place remaining tiles automatically
- **Pattern Detection**: Checks for "FOX" in all 8 directions
- **Visual Feedback**: Losing FOX patterns are highlighted in green
